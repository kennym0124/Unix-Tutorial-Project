Contains every single location for the game.
Upon moving here, a script will be run that displays where the player can go.
You might notice a "visitedFlag" file--the idea is that something different will be shown upon entering a location for the first time.
As such, any directory without one will play something once, and then something else every single time the player reenters it (should they feel they need to).
Those obviously aren't gonna be there on a new game startup. Nothing's been implemented with them yet either.
