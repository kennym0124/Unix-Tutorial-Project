Looking at the program logs again, I'm not the only one who's transfered data here.
Of course, typical status reports and the like have been transfered, but there's something out of the ordinary here...
The name seems to have an [E] or [L] in it, but the rest's been covered. Hell, it's hard to make anything out even now.
Not only that, but it's being transfered to some other server other than [SkALd HQ]'s.
