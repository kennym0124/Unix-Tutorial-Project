Before ejecting everything from the trash chute, you grabbed a peculiar note.
Every document printed on this ship is scanned and saved into the server, but I've got no recollection of something like this.
A lot of it has been scratched out or burned, but it seems to have been issued from a separate organization.
The middle of the note seems to have my codename, along with [GREEN] and [WHITE].
